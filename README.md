# Plant-Disease-Detection
A simple plant disease detector. It can detect scabs, blotches and rot in leaves. Accuracy is about 53%. Further work is in progress to make it more accurate.
I have used the 'apple disease' zip file which I downloaded from Kaggle. I uploaded it unto Google Colab and ran the code from there. This model uses the data to detect 
whether the plant leaf has rot, blotches or scabs.
